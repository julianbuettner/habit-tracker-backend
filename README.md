## Okay what?
This is meant to be a backend maintaining a postgres
database which can be used by grafana to display your development of habits.

It is supposed to track things like
- productive hours (studying, working)
- healthy meals (e.g. salad made with effort)
- push ups

with counterparts like
- guilty pleasure time hours (Netflix)
- unhealthy meals (table of chocolate)
